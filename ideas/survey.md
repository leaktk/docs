# Survey sub-command option

Provide a `<tool> survey` option to the cli tools that provides
a link to a survey that people can take to provide feedback.

Requirements:

- Must be anonymous (one of the goals of the project is to respect user privacy)
- Should gather relevant data for the tool (so it might require multiple surveys)
- The link should be configurable (so that down stream tooling can point at different surveys)

Nice to have:

- Include a note on where to file an issue in the survey if they want to
  collab on fixing any issues.
