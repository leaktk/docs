# Slack Secrets Monitoring

Consider doing something like [this project](https://github.com/PaperMtn/slack-watchman-enterprise-grid).

Important: We want to make sure to respect user privacy as much as possible!
So if exploring this, we'll want to figure out ways to do it that minimize how
data is captured if any is.

Also it might make sense to just use the upstream project and either generate
patterns for it, or find a way to hook our scanner into it.

Still need to do feasibility assessment on the whole idea though.
