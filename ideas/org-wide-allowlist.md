# Have an org wide allowlist

If a user has a .leaktk project in their org, support adding a custom allowlist
format where they can add detached allowlists for their repos or for every repo
across the org.

Also it might be good to support something similar for local tools like a
similar file at ~/.config/leaktk/filename

It might be good to have pattern matching for figuring out which repos to
apply the rules to so that it can be flexible enough to work in different
situations.
