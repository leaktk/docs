# UX Improvment Ideas

Make the install as smooth as possible consider:

- Supporting lazy steps so things are configured as needed
- Assuming sane defaults where possible and allowing overrides (but make sure to make it clear what the defaults are)
- Consider interactive installs by default and supporting non-interactive installs as well
- Reduce the number of steps to as few as possible
- Make sure updates are handled
