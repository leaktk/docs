# Ansible Plugin

Create an Ansible module for scanning multiple things at once.

This could be cool when coupled with event driven Ansible.

Will need to play around with which ways make the most sense for doing it at scale and
see what kinds of plugins make sense.

Also might make sense to have ansible roles for deploying a pwnedalert setup and 
other similar things.
