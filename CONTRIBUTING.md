# Contributing

This covers the types of contributions for this docs repo. For contributing to
other repos see their CONTRIBUTING.md files or, if one doesn't exist, file an
issue on the repo requesting one be created.

## Types of Contributions

### Docs for Tools Version > 0.0.0

Anything at 0.0.0 is still under heavy development and isn't ready for use yet.
Contributions to that project are desired first. You can check out the
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for more info so your contributions align
with the vision of the project.

### Corrections & Clarifications

If any information in this docs repo is incorrect or there are typos or any
other kinds of mistakes, feel free to submit a MRâ€”even if it's a small
tweak. We also want the info to be "intuitively obvious to the most casual
observer".

### Doc Requests

If something isn't documented and you'd like it to be, file an issue and we'll
take a look.
